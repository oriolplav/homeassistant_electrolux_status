## Details
This is an integration to Home Assistant to communicate with the Electrolux OCP Platform (probably for One Connectivity Platform), Electrolux owned brands, like: Electrolux, AEG, Frigidaire, Husqvarna.

Tested with Electrolux and AEG washer-dryer, but probably could be used with some internet connected ovens, diswashers, fridges, airconditioners.

**Last changes :**
- Added support for temperatures
- Added Wifi link quality sensor
- Renamed connection state to connectivity status (old entity should be deleted if exists)

**Known issues :**
- Some commands don't work (to be investigated) : several dropdown lists like setting analog temperature...
